That's the right approach. Don't start coding immediately.

For a system of this size, the biggest mistake is building components before locking down the infrastructure, model serving, storage, and deployment architecture.

Based on everything we've discussed, I'd suggest treating this as a sequence of phases, where each phase produces a working, testable system.

# Agreed Architecture

Before starting, let's lock the stack:

```text
OS
  RHEL 9

Frontend
  OpenWebUI

Backend Extensions
  FastAPI

Model Serving
  vLLM

Main Model
  Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct AWQ

Embedding Model
  BGE-M3

Reranker
  BGE-Reranker-v2-M3

Document Parsing
  Docling

OCR
  PaddleOCR

Metadata DB
  MySQL 8

Vector DB
  Qdrant

Graph DB
  Neo4j (later)

Container Runtime
  Podman or Docker

Reverse Proxy
  Nginx

GPU
  NVIDIA A40 48GB
```

# Revised Project Roadmap

## Phase 0 — Infrastructure Foundation

Goal:

```text
GPU
Drivers
CUDA
Container Runtime
Storage
Networking
```

Deliverables:

* NVIDIA driver
* CUDA
* Container runtime
* Persistent storage layout
* Internal DNS/hostname
* Firewall rules

Verify:

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

must show:

```text
A40 48GB
```

---

## Phase 1 — Model Serving Layer

Goal:

```text
vLLM running
```

Deliverables:

```text
Qwen2.5-VL-32B AWQ
served through OpenAI API
```

Verify:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/models
```

returns model list.

No OpenWebUI yet.

No RAG yet.

Just inference.

---

## Phase 2 — OpenWebUI

Goal:

```text
Chat UI
```

Deliverables:

```text
OpenWebUI
↓
vLLM
↓
Qwen2.5-VL
```

Verify:

* text chat
* image upload
* image understanding

No documents.

No retrieval.

---

## Phase 3 — Database Layer

Goal:

```text
MySQL
Qdrant
```

Install:

### MySQL

Store:

```text
users
files
documents
chunks
conversations
messages
citations
jobs
```

### Qdrant

Store:

```text
embeddings
```

Verify:

* CRUD works
* Qdrant collections created

---

## Phase 4 — Embedding Service

Goal:

```text
BGE-M3
```

Deploy:

BGE-M3

Verify:

```text
Text
↓
Embedding
↓
Vector
```

works.

---

## Phase 5 — Retrieval Layer

Goal:

```text
Qdrant Search
```

Pipeline:

```text
Query
↓
Embedding
↓
Qdrant
↓
Top K
```

No reranker yet.

Verify retrieval quality.

---

## Phase 6 — Reranking

Deploy:

BGE-Reranker-v2-M3

Pipeline:

```text
Query
↓
Embedding
↓
Qdrant
↓
50 Chunks
↓
Reranker
↓
10 Chunks
```

Verify:

* better ranking
* lower hallucinations

---

## Phase 7 — Document Intelligence

Install:

* Docling
* PaddleOCR

Pipeline:

```text
PDF
↓
Docling
↓
OCR if needed
↓
Structured Markdown
↓
Chunking
↓
Embeddings
```

Verify:

* PDFs
* scanned PDFs
* DOCX
* PPTX
* XLSX

---

## Phase 8 — RAG Integration

Pipeline:

```text
User
↓
Question
↓
Retrieval
↓
Context
↓
Qwen2.5-VL
↓
Answer
```

Add citations.

---

## Phase 9 — Vision-Aware RAG

Pipeline:

```text
PDF Page
Chart
Diagram
Screenshot
↓
Docling
↓
Vision Extraction
↓
Embeddings
↓
Retrieval
↓
Qwen2.5-VL
```

This is where the system becomes truly multimodal.

---

## Phase 10 — Neo4j (Optional)

Only after everything above works.

Implement:

```text
Entity Extraction
Knowledge Graph
Graph Retrieval
```

Do not start with Neo4j.

---

# First Question Before We Begin

Can you share the target server specifications?

Specifically:

```text
CPU Model
Number of Cores / Threads
RAM
Storage Layout
RHEL Version
A40 Driver Version (if installed)
```

Example:

```text
RHEL 9.4
Intel Xeon Gold 6338
64 Cores
256 GB RAM
2 TB NVMe
NVIDIA A40 48GB
```

Once we have that, we'll start with **Phase 0 (Infrastructure Foundation)** and produce a detailed installation and validation plan for RHEL.
